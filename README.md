# BateMao CardGame

## Introduction
This repository harbours the program that simulates the Card Game "Bate MÃ£o" in C programming language.
The catch in this code is that it runs the game utilising dynamic memory allocation effectively.

## Rules of the Game
The Game works with four players and one deck of 52 cards, where all of the deck(shuffled) is distribuited equally between all four players. Then each player discards one card of his pile of cards to the table, to which runs a counter from card "A" to "K". If the respective player happens to discard from his pile the same card "number" that the counter is on, he must retrieve all of the cards on the table to his own pile. And so the game works by this rules until one of the players has 0 cards in his pile, which means that this player won the game.
